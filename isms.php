<p>We provide ISO 27001 consulting and implementation support. This includes a phase wise approach that involves understanding business context to information security, information asset identification, information valuation, security valuation, technical and procedural risk assessment, gap analysis against ISO 27001 114 controls, detail recommendations, policy/documentation support, training, coaching employees/teams, coaching security managers, security performance setting, gap implementation monitoring, audit and management review leading to successful zero defect ISO 27001 &ndash; 2013 certification.<br /> Our ISO 27001 consulting methodology ensures several benefits. This includes identification of all vulnerabilities in the Infrastructure be it related to technology, skill, vendor or locations. Top Management can clearly see the overall risk reduction in the organization and the way it is embedded in each business life cycle.<br /> What is Information Security Management System (ISMS)?<br /> A step-by-step method of identifying information that is key to business success. ISMS also include a comprehensive approach in assessing risks on one hand, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Such opportunities take the shape of designing, documenting, implementing, measuring , auditing and continuously improving information security posture. Improvement can take place both due to proactive process such as risk assessment, and reactive such as Incidents. In simple words, a proactive approach to preventing and reacting to information related incidents.<br /> The ability to be aware of what is our present weakness and our ability to know how we will react&ndash; is in essence a true impact of a formal ISMS. On the contrary not being aware of any aspect of the any part of the system and its security relevance, or the approach that we will take in case of a failure &ndash; therefore demonstrates the absence of ISMS.</p>
